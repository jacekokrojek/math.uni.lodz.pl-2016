Hi,

According to our today discussion around issues with accessing MR Buggy 2 application putting optional application you can work on while performing exploratory testing session.

- Go to http://www.orangehrm.com/OpenSource.php and expand 'Features'
- Chose one of the feature and read the short spec of that functionality
- Run Rapid reporter and define your charter
- Open following link http://opensource.demo.orangehrmlive.com/
- Run your session and remember to take some notes
- Convert session report to html format
- Send all reports in html format to https://github.com/jacekokrojek/math.uni.lodz.pl-2016

Best regards,
≈Åukasz Urbaniak
